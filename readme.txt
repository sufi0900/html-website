Technologies Used
The website is crafted using a blend of powerful web development technologies:

1. HTML: The backbone of the website structure.
2. CSS: Responsible for styling and layout.

4. Bootstrap: Ensures a responsive and mobile-first design.
5. jQuery: Facilitates DOM manipulation and simplifies JavaScript.
Sections of the Website
1. Responsive Navbar

Imagine a super helpful guide that shows you where to go on the website, no matter what device you're using. That's the magic of a responsive navbar! It adjusts its size and layout to fit any screen, making navigation a breeze.
<nav class="navbar navbar-default bootsnav navbar-sticky navbar-scrollspy" data-minus-value-desktop="70" data-minus-value-mobile="55" data-speed="1000">

5.Responsive Footer that Doesn't Skip Leg Day

Just like the navbar, the footer resizes itself to look good on any device. Built with HTML and CSS, it holds all that important info like contact details, copyright stuff (gotta be legal, folks!), and maybe even links to your social media channels.
